# Introduction to MongoDB Hands-on Workshop

This repository exists to host files supporting the MongoDB Hands-on Workshop, which is designed to get you familiar with all aspects of MongoDB, from deploying a cluster, to loading data to creating services to access that data. 

This workshop is divided into several parts:
* [Part 1 - Atlas](http://tinyurl.com/MongoWorkshopAtlas), our fully managed database service, and Compass, the GUI for MongoDB,
* [Part 2 - Triggers](http://tinyurl.com/MongoWorkshopTriggers), our data change event handler,
* [Part 3 - App Services](http://tinyurl.com/MongoWorkshopAppServices), our serverless application platform,
* [Part 4 - Aggregation](http://tinyurl.com/MongoWorkshopAgg), our framework for returning results from a group of data,
* [Part 5 - Search]([https://[bit.ly/MongoWorkshopSearch], our [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) based text indexer that provides advanced search functionality, and
* [Part 6 - Charts](http://tinyurl.com/MongoWorkshopCharts), our data visualization tool

Each part contains several lab exercises. The free environment you create in this lab will be yours forever.

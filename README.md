# Introduction to MongoDB Hands-on Workshop

This repository exists to host files supporting the MongoDB Hands-on Workshop, which is designed to get you familiar with all aspects of MongoDB, from deploying a cluster, to loading data to creating services to access that data. 

This workshop is divided into several parts:
* [Part 1 - Atlas](http://bit.ly/MongoWorkshopAtlas), our fully managed database service, and Compass, the GUI for MongoDB
* [Part 2 - Triggers](http://bit.ly/MongoWorkshopTriggers), our data change event handler
* [Part 3 - Stitch](http://bit.ly/MongoWorkshopStitch), our serverless application platform, and 
* [Part 4 - Charts](http://bit.ly/MongoWorkshopCharts), our data visualization tool

Each part contains several lab exercises. Don’t worry about completing all lab exercises in this sitting. The free environment you create in this lab will be yours forever.
